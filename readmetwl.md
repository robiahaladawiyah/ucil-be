Features
Outline the main features of your website. For example:

CRUD Operations: Allows users to create, read, update, and delete theme data.
Data Visualization: Displays the theme data in a table.
Secure API: Implements authentication logic to secure all API endpoints.
Password Hashing: Stores passwords in the database using bcrypt for enhanced security.
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Generates and stores tokens in local storage for user authentication.
Installation
To run the project locally, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Node.js and npm: Download Node.js and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
After installing Node.js and npm, follow these steps to set up the project:

Clone the repository:

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
Install the project dependencies:

shell
Copy code
cd your-project
npm install
This will install all the necessary dependencies, including:

jwt: JSON Web Token library for user authentication.
bcrypt: Library for password hashing.
express: Web framework for building the back-end server.
mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool for database operations.
cors: Middleware to enable cross-origin resource sharing.
react-bootstrap: Library for UI components in React.
react-big-calendar: Calendar component for React applications.
cookie-parser: Middleware for parsing cookies in Express.
react: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
react-router-dom: Routing library for React applications.
Start the development server:

shell
Copy code
npm start
This will run the application on http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Make sure to update the dependency list according to the specific versions you are using. If there are additional steps or configurations required, you can include them in this section as well.

Usage
Explain how to use the application or provide a step-by-step guide on how to perform certain tasks.
